## Product Description

**RAK11200** is a **WisBlock Core** module for RAK **WisBlock** based on Espressif ESP32-WROVER. It is a powerful, generic WiFi-BLE MCU module that targets a wide variety of applications. There are two CPU cores that can be individually controlled and the CPU clock frequency is adjustable from 80 MHz to 240 MHz. The Low-Power Deep-Sleep current of ESP32-WROVER is about 10 ¬µA. This makes the **RAK11200** an ultra-low-power communication solution. **RAK11200** can be comfortably programmed with the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

## Product Features
 
* Two low-power Xtensa¬Æ 32-bit LX6 microprocessors      
* Up to 240 MHz CPU clock
* Built-in PCB antenna
* 4 MB External SPI Flash, 520 KB RAM
* 8 MB SPI Pseudo static RAM (PSRAM)
* WiFi 802.11 b/g/n (802.11n up to 150 Mbps)
* Bluetooth v4.2 BR/EDR and BLE specification
* Rich set of peripherals: RTC, UART, I2C, SPI, SD card interface
* Low-power Deep-Sleep mode

## Prerequisites

To use a **RAK11200**, you need at least a [WisBlock Base](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK5005-O/Overview/#product-description) to plug the module in. **WisBlock Base** is the power supply for the **RAK11200** module and has a programming/debug interface.
