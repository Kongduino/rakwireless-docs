## Product Description


**RAK5005-O** is a WisBlock Base board that connects all **WisBlock** modules together and provides the power supply for attached **WisBlock** modules.

The **RAK5005-O** has one slot reserved for the WisBlock Core moduleÔºåfour slots, A to D, for WisBlock modules and one slot, the IO slot, for bigger WisBlock modules. Also, there are **2.54 mm pitch connectors** for extension interfaces, such as **I2C**, **UART**, and **GPIO**.

For convenience, there is a USB connector for debugging. It is connected directly to the MCU‚Äôs USB port (if supported). The customer can access the internal MCU by connecting to a computer‚Äôs USB port directly. This USB connector is also used as a battery charging port.

Each module can be connected and fastened easily and securely. These connectors are **high-speed board to board connectors**, they provide signal integrity for each data bus. A set of screws are used to secure the module under an environment with vibrations.

To avoid electromagnetic and heating interferences, the sensor connectors on the WisBlock Base are designed to be installed on both sides of the PCB. Thus a sensor module can be attached either on the top layer or the bottom layer of the WisBlock Base board. heating interferences can also be offset by using a [RAK19005 Sensor Extension Cable](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK19005/Overview/), a 12-cm cable that allows you to connect a sensor away from the base itself, ideal for environment-related sensors.

**RAK5005-O** is as well the mounting base when you put your solution into a case. **RAK5005-O** has connectors for the following:

* 1 WisBlock Core module
* 1 WisBlock Module compatible with IO Slot
* 4 WisBlock Modules compatible to Slot A-D
* 1 USB port for programming and debugging
* 3.7V Rechargeable battery connector
* 5V Solar Panel connector
* I2C, UART, GPIO's and analog input accessible with solder contacts

It has two user-definable LEDs as well, one power supply/charging indicator LED and a reset button.

## Product Features

* **Power supply**     
    * **RAK5005-O** supports both 5V USB and a 3.7V rechargeable battery as power supply. In addition, it has a connector for a 5V solar panel to recharge the battery in a remote location.
    * Control of power consumption
    **RAK5005-O** has an electronic power switch for the supply to the **WisBlock modules**. The power supply for some of the **WisBlock Sensor** boards and most of the **WisBlock modules** boards can be controlled by the **WisBlock Core** modules application.

* **Size**    
    * **RAK5005-O** has a size of only 30 x 60 mm, which lets you create solutions that fit into the smallest housings.

## Prerequisites 

WisBlock Base is amazingly easy to use and requires only a USB cable to start developing with the system.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING    
- Only 3.7-4.2V Rechargeable LiPo batteries are supported. Do not use other types of batteries with the system.
- Only 5V solar panels are supported. Do not use 12V solar panels. It will destroy the charging unit and eventually other electronic parts.
